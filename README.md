# Open-GoogleSites
Open's Google Sites via Chrome in the Windows OS
- This program checks if Chrome exists, if it does it:
  - Open Gmail
  - Open Google Calendar
  - Open Google Drive
- If Google Chrome does not exist it downloads chrome, installs it, then opens the links
- Press retun / enter (within the program window) to quickly close Chrome when done
---
**Why?**:
- Code is easy to update with whatever links you like opened, use pyinstaller (pip3 install pyinstaller) to create an exectutable
- Drop executable shortcut into the startup folder to have the sites open during startup -- saves me time from doing this repititous task when logging into my PC in the morning

*(It opens Chrome and the tabs in another window)*
